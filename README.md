## K-Means-Cluster-Solver
This C++ program demonstrates the k-means clustering algorithm, a method for partitioning a set of data points into a specified number of clusters. Here's a brief overview of the program:

## Usage
Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
Run the compiled executable.

## Functionality
The program defines a Point struct representing a point in a 2D space with x and y coordinates.
It implements functions to cluster points around center points and calculate Euclidean distances.
The main loop iteratively refines the positions of cluster centers until convergence.
Convergence occurs when the new center points match the old center points.

## Input
Input data points are defined in the main function.

## Output
The program outputs the iteration number and distances between points and cluster centers.
Upon convergence, it prints the final clusters with their respective center points.
